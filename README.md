# uni

A lightweight Minecraft networking interface for Velocity servers.

## About

Uni is a work in progress. As of now, it only supports Linux 5.1 and above as
it uses the io_uring library.

## Usage

More documentation will be added as the library is completed. Look through the
[example](example/main.c) along with [uni.h](include/uni.h) for more
information. They are well-documented.
